characterized absence belief existence god atheists believe god exist former often referred weak atheist position latter strong atheism important note difference two positions weak atheism simple scepticism disbelief existence god strong atheism positive belief god exist please fall trap assuming atheists strong atheists atheists believe non existence gods others limit atheism specific gods christian god rather making flat denials disbelieving god thing believing exist definitely disbelief proposition means one believe true believing something true equivalent believing false one may simply idea whether true brings agnosticism agnosticism term agnosticism coined professor huxley meeting metaphysical society defined agnostic someone disclaimed strong atheism believed ultimate origin things must cause unknown unknowable thus agnostic someone believes know sure whether god exists words slippery things language inexact beware assuming work someone philosophical point view simply fact calls atheist agnostic example many people use agnosticism mean weak atheism use word atheism referring strong atheism beware also word atheist many shades meaning difficult generalize atheists say sure atheists believe god example certainly case atheists believe science best way find universe philosophical justification basis atheism many philosophical justifications atheism find particular person chooses atheist best ask many atheists feel idea god presented major religions essentially self contradictory logically impossible god could exist others atheists scepticism see evidence god exists impossible prove non existence something many counter examples statement example quite simple prove exist prime number larger prime numbers course deals well defined objects obeying well defined rules whether gods universes similarly well defined matter debate however assuming moment existence god provably impossible still subtle reasons assuming non existence god assume something exist always possible show assumption invalid finding single counter example hand assume something exist thing question provably impossible showing assumption invalid may require exhaustive search possible places thing might found show exhaustive search often impractical impossible problem largest primes prove exist therefore generally accepted must assume things exist unless evidence even theists follow rule time believe unicorns even though conclusively prove unicorns exist anywhere assume god exists make assumption probably tested make exhaustive search everywhere god might prove exist anywhere sceptical atheist assumes default god exist since assumption test profess strong atheism usually claim sort god exists instead generally restrict claims cover varieties god described followers various religions whilst may impossible prove conclusively god exists may possible prove say god described particular religious book exist may even possible prove god described present day religion exists practice believing god described religion exists close believing god exists however sufficiently different counter arguments based impossibility disproving every kind god really applicable god essentially non detectable god interacts universe way effects interaction must measurable hence interaction universe must detectable god essentially non detectable must therefore case interact universe way many atheists would argue god interact universe importance whether exists bible believed god easily detectable israelites surely still detectable today note demanding god interact scientifically verifiable physical way must surely possible perceive effect caused presence though otherwise distinguish things exist may think philosophical justification atheism still religious belief one common pastimes philosophical discussion redefinition game cynical view game follows person begins making contentious statement person points true person gradually defines words used statement arrives something person prepared accept records statement along fact person agreed continues eventually uses statement agreed fact uses original definitions words rather obscure redefinitions originally needed get agree rather seen apparently inconsistent tend play along point digression answer question atheism religious belief depends crucially upon meant religious religion generally characterized belief superhuman controlling power especially sort god faith worship worth pointing passing varieties buddhism religion according definition atheism certainly belief sort superhuman power categorized worship meaningful sense widening definition religious encompass atheism tends result many aspects human behaviour suddenly becoming classed religious well science politics watching religion surely belief atheism science still act faith like religion firstly entirely clear sceptical atheism something one actually believes secondly necessary adopt number core beliefs assumptions make sort sense sensory data experience atheists try adopt core beliefs possible even subject questioning experience throws doubt science number core assumptions example generally assumed laws physics observers sort core assumptions atheists make basic ideas called acts faith almost everything know must said based acts faith term loses meaning faith often used refer complete certain belief something according definition atheism science certainly acts faith course individual atheists scientists dogmatic religious followers claiming something certain general tendency however many atheists would reluctant state certainty universe exists faith also used refer belief without supporting evidence proof sceptical atheism certainly fit definition sceptical atheism beliefs strong atheism closer still really match even dogmatic atheist tend refer experimental data lack asserting god exist atheism religious surely anti religious unfortunate human tendency label everyone either friend enemy truth clear cut atheism position runs logically counter theism sense said anti religion however religious believers speak atheists anti religious usually mean atheists sort antipathy hatred towards theists categorization atheists hostile towards religion quite unfair atheist attitudes towards theists fact cover broad spectrum atheists take live let live attitude unless questioned usually mention atheism except perhaps close friends course may part atheism socially acceptable many countries atheists quite anti religious may even try convert others possible historically anti religious atheists made little impact society outside eastern bloc countries digress slightly soviet union originally dedicated separation church state like usa soviet citizens legally free worship wished institution state atheism came stalin took control soviet union tried destroy churches order gain complete power population atheists quite vocal beliefs see religion encroaching matters business example government usa individuals usually concerned church state remain separate allow religion say running state surely state atheism principle separation church state state shall legislate concerning matters religious belief particular means state promote one religion expense another also promote belief religious nature religions still say discussion purely secular matters example religious believers historically responsible encouraging many political reforms even today many organizations campaigning increase spending foreign aid founded religious campaigns long campaign concerning secular matters long discriminate religious grounds atheists quite happy see say prayer schools god care people pray people pray voters lawmakers tend things pray ignore also christian prayer schools intimidating non christians even told need join diversity religious non religious belief means impossible formulate meaningful prayer acceptable present public event also non prayers tend friends family pray reasonable care friends family wasting time even without motives mentioned christians campaign increased foreign aid atheists atheist charities hospitals atheists object religious charities many charities without religious purpose atheists contribute atheists contribute religious charities well sake practical good atheists even voluntary work charities founded theistic basis atheists seem feel atheism worth shouting connection charity atheism simple obvious everyday matter charity many feel somewhat cheap say self righteous use simple charity excuse plug particular set religious beliefs weak atheists building hospital say believe god rather strange idea rather like holding party say today birthday fuss atheism rarely evangelical said atheism anti religious perhaps backlash one upbringing way rebelling perhaps many people parents attempt force religious atheist ideas upon many people choose call atheists also doubtless case religious people chose religion backlash atheist upbringing way different hand many people choose religion way conforming expectations others whole conclude much whether atheism religion backlash conformism although general people tendency along group rather act think independently atheists differ religious people believe god atheists may listen heavy metal backwards even may prefer verdi requiem even know words may wear hawaiian shirts may dress black may even wear orange robes many buddhists lack belief sort god atheists even carry copy bible around arguing course whoever chances met several atheists without realising atheists usually unexceptional behaviour appearance unexceptional atheists less moral religious people depends define morality obedience god course atheists less moral obey god usually one talks morality one talks acceptable right unacceptable wrong behaviour within society humans social animals maximally successful must operate good enough reason discourage atheists anti social immoral behaviour purely purposes self preservation many atheists behave moral compassionate way simply feel natural tendency empathize humans care happens others know simply way naturally people behave immorally try use atheism justify actions however equally many people behave immorally try use religious beliefs justify actions example trustworthy saying deserves full acceptance jesus

often one makes sense hence choice person honestly make atheists want believe god atheists live lives though nobody watching many desire watched matter good natured big brother figure might atheists would like able believe god one believe things merely one wants true risks approach obvious atheists often decide wanting believe something enough must evidence belief course atheists see evidence existence god unwilling souls see many atheists previously religious explained vast majority seriously considered possibility god exists many atheists spent time prayer trying reach god course true

meaning purpose random events however means obvious life sort thing meaning put another way everything looks like question actually sensible thing ask atheists believe asking meaning life silly asking meaning cup coffee believe life purpose meaning atheists find comfort time danger many ways obtaining comfort family friends even pets less spiritual level food drink may sound rather empty vulnerable way face danger individuals believe things comforting face reality matter harsh might end decision individual concerned atheists unable believe something would otherwise believe merely makes feel comfortable put truth comfort consider searching truth sometimes makes feel unhappy hard luck atheists worry might suddenly shown wrong short answer many atheists atheists years encountered many arguments much supposed evidence existence god found invalid inconclusive thousands years religious belief resulted good proof existence god atheists therefore tend feel unlikely proved wrong immediate future stop worrying theists question beliefs arguments apply beliefs questioned similar weak atheism sceptical default position take asserts nothing strong atheism negative belief theism strong positive belief atheists sometimes also argue theists question beliefs real harm cause believers everyone else sort harm religion represents huge financial work burden mankind matter religious

priest ceasing take medicines prescribed doctors dying result theists died refused blood transfusions religious grounds arguable catholic church opposition birth control condoms particular increasing problem overpopulation many third world countries contributing spread aids world wide religious believers known murder children rather allow children become atheists marry someone different religion real believers claimed believers sort excuse makes real believer many one true religions hard tell look christianity many competing groups convinced true christians sometimes even fight kill atheist supposed decide real christian even major christian churches like catholic church church england decide amongst end atheists take pragmatic view decide anyone calls christian uses christian belief dogma justify actions considered christian maybe christians perverting christian teaching ends surely bible readily used support christian acts much moral code bible word god made less easy misinterpret know beliefs perversion god intended single unambiguous interpretation bible atheist take one interpretation another say sorry someone claims believes jesus murdered others jesus bible told must call christian obviously extreme sorts beliefs questioned since nobody ever proved god exist must unlikely basic religious beliefs shared faiths nonsense hold pointed start dialogue positive assertions concerning existence entities inherently much harder disprove negative ones nobody ever proved unicorns exist make unlikely myths therefore much valid hold negative assertion default hold positive assertion default course weak atheists would argue asserting nothing better still well atheism great many theists unfortunately popularity belief little correct whether works consider many people believe astrology graphology pseudo sciences many atheists feel simply human weakness want believe gods certainly many primitive human societies religion allows people deal phenomena adequately understand course religion industrialized world find people believing religious explanations phenomena even perfectly adequate natural explanations religion may started means attempting explain world nowadays serves purposes well many cultures developed religions surely must say something really religions superficially similar example worth remembering religions buddhism taoism lack sort concept god christian sense course religions quick denounce competing religions rather odd use one religion try justify another famous scientists philosophers concluded god exists every scientist philosopher believes god one besides already pointed truth belief determined many people believe also important realize atheists view famous scientists philosophers way theists view religious leaders famous

buehler schism disobedience according thomas aquinas schism consists primarily refusal submission pope communion members church united first sight would appear whatever subjective motivation archbishop discussed must state objective schism refused submit pope grave matter involving supreme power jurisdiction however standard catholic textbooks theology make clear schisms involve disobedience acts disobedience schismatic noted beginning article would mean number american bishops schismatic would reach double figures distinction disobedience schism made clear article schism authoritative dictionnaire theologie catholique article father yves congar certainly friend archbishop lefebvre explains schism disobedience similar often confused father congar writes schism involves refusal accept existence legitimate authority church example luther rejection papacy father congar explains refusal accept decision legitimate authority particular instance constitute schism disobedience catholic encyclopedia explains catholic truly schismatic would intend sever church far lies adds every disobedience schism order possess character must include besides transgression command superiors denial divine right command mgr lefebvre deny divine right pope command affirms repeatedly recognition pope authority intention never breaking away rome archbishop made attitude clear july august issue days pray pope every day nothing changed consecrations last june sedevacantists recognize john paul legitimate pope catholic church even say heretical pope say modernist actions favor heresy intrinsically schismatic principal argument used claiming mgr lefebvre schism consecration bishop without papal mandate intrinsically schismatic act bishop carries consecration claimed becomes ipso facto schismatic true consecration intrinsically schismatic act would always involved penalty excommunication code canon law offence punished suspension see canon code pope pius xii raised penalty excommunication response establishment schismatic church china consecration illicit chinese bishops differed radically consecrations carried mgr lefebvre professed intention repudiate authority pope deny right govern church illicitly consecrated chinese bishops given mandate exercise apostolic mission neither archbishop lefebvre bishops consecrated claim powers jurisdiction consecrated solely purpose ensuring survival society carrying ordinations also perform confirmations wish minimize way gravity step take mgr lefebvre consecration bishops without papal mandate far serious matter ordination priests involves refusal practice primacy jurisdiction belonging divine right roman pontiff archbishop could argue crisis afflicting church could grave grave measures needed response appears taken granted archbishop critics excommunicated offense schism vatican certainly guilty fostering impression much modicum truth allegation new code canon law includes section beginning canon entitled penalties specific offenses poenis singula dicta first part deals offenses religion unity church delictis contra religionem ecclesiae unitatem canon deals offense schism evidently together apostasy heresy one three fundamental offenses unity church archbishop excommunicated terms canon indeed canon involving offense religion unity church canon cited excommunication comes third section penalties specific offenses entitled usurpation ecclesial functions offenses exercise munerum ecclesiasticorum usurpatione degue delictis iniis exercendis canon question canon reads bishop consecrates someone bishop person receives consecration bishop without pontifical mandate incur automatic latae sententiae excommunication reserved holy see scandalous attempts smear archbishop lefebvre offense schism contrary truth charity comparable smear civil opposed ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action libel involving massive damages accurate parallel would state man convicted manslaughter convicted first degree murder must stress written dubious opinion laymen unversed intricacies canon law canon lawyers without least shred sympathy mgr lefebvre repudiated charge schism made totally untenable father patrick yaldrini dean faculty canon law institut catholique paris noted july issue valeurs actuelles explained mgr lefebvre excommunicated schism usurpation ecclesiastical function added consecration bishop constitutes schism conferral apostolic mission upon illicitly consecrated bishop usurpation powers sovereign pontiff proves intention establishing parallel church cardinal rosalio lara president pontifical commission authentic interpretation canon law commented consecrations july issue repubblica would hard act consecrating bishop without papal mandate schismatic act fact code deals offenses divided two sections one deals offenses religion unity church apostasy schism heresy consecrating bishop pontifical mandate contrary offense exercise specific ministry example case consecrations carried vietnamese archbishop ngo dinh thuc although archbishop excommunicated considered committed schismatic act intention breach church simply unjust ludicrous suggest consecrating bishops without papal mandate archbishop lefebvre least intent establishing schismatic church schismatic never schismatic archbishop considers correctly church undergoing worst crisis since arian heresy good church necessary consecrate four bishops ensure future society canon law provides situation even one believes future society could guaranteed without consecrations fact archbishop believed sincerely could means canon law states clearly incurred excommunication furthermore vatican allows prelates archbishop weakland undermine faith impunity expect catholics pay least attention sanctions great orthodox archbishop whose entire life devoted service church salvation souls eric saventhem president

archive name atheism logic alt atheism archive name logic last modified april version constructing logical argument although much argument usenet general quality argument found poor article attempts provide gentle introduction logic hope improving general level debate logic science reasoning proof thinking inference concise oed logic allows analyze piece reasoning determine whether correct valid invalid course one need study logic order reason correctly nevertheless little basic knowledge logic often helpful constructing analyzing argument note claim made whether logic universally applicable matter much open debate document merely explains use logic given already decided logic right tool job propositions statements building blocks logical argument proposition statement either true false example raining today tuesday propositions may either asserted said true denied said false note technical meaning deny everyday meaning proposition meaning statement particular arrangement words used express god exists exists god express proposition argument quote monty python sketch connected series statements establish definite proposition argument consists three stages first propositions necessary argument continue stated called premises argument evidence reasons accepting argument conclusions premises assertions often indicated phrases since obviously phrase obviously often viewed suspicion used intimidate others accepting suspicious premises something seem obvious afraid question always say yes right obvious heard explanation next premises used derive propositions process known inference inference one proposition arrived basis one propositions already accepted various forms valid inference propositions arrived inference may used inference inference often denoted phrases implies therefore finally arrive conclusion argument proposition affirmed basis premises inference conclusions often indicated phrases therefore follows conclude conclusion often stated final stage inference example every event cause premise universe beginning premise beginnings involve event premise implies beginning universe involved event inference therefore universe cause inference conclusion note conclusion one argument might premise another argument proposition called premise conclusion respect particular argument terms make sense isolation sometimes argument follow order given example conclusions might stated first premises stated afterwards support conclusion perfectly valid sometimes little confusing recognizing argument much harder recognizing premises conclusions many people shower writing assertions without ever producing anything one might reasonably describe argument statements look like arguments example bible accurate jesus must either insane evil liar son god argument conditional statement assert premises necessary support appears conclusion also suffers number logical flaws come later another example god created therefore duty god phrase duty god proposition since neither true false therefore conclusion sentence argument finally causality important consider statement form interested establishing offered evidence statement argument trying establish truth argument explanation example must something wrong engine car start argument car start something wrong engine explanation two traditional types argument deductive inductive deductive argument one provides conclusive proof conclusions argument premises true conclusion must also true deductive argument either valid invalid valid argument defined one premises true conclusion true inductive argument one premises provide evidence truth conclusion inductive arguments valid invalid however talk whether better worse arguments probable premises forms argument ordinary language neither deductive inductive however concentrate moment deductive arguments often viewed rigorous convincing important note fact deductive argument valid imply conclusion holds slightly counter intuitive nature implication must consider carefully obviously valid argument consist true propositions however argument may entirely valid even contains false propositions example insects wings premise woodlice insects premise therefore woodlice wings conclusion conclusion true argument premises false argument premises true however conclusion would true argument thus entirely valid subtly reach true conclusion one false premises fish live sea premise dolphins fish premise therefore dolphins live sea conclusion however one thing reach false conclusion valid inference true premises therefore draw truth table implication symbol denotes implication premise conclusion represent true false respectively premise conclusion inference premises false inference valid conclusion true false premises true conclusion false inference must invalid premises true inference valid conclusion must true sound argument valid argument whose premises true sound argument therefore arrives true conclusion careful confuse valid arguments sound arguments delve structure logical arguments would require lengthy discussion linguistics philosophy simpler probably useful summarize major pitfalls avoided constructing argument pitfalls known fallacies everyday english term fallacy used refer mistaken beliefs well faulty reasoning leads beliefs fair enough logic term generally used refer form technically incorrect argument especially argument appears valid convincing purposes discussion define fallacy logical argument appears correct seen incorrect examined closely studying fallacies aim avoid misled following list fallacies intended exhaustive argumentum baculum appeal force appeal force committed arguer resorts force threat force order try push acceptance conclusion often used politicians summarized might makes right force threatened need direct threat arguer example thus ample proof truth bible refuse accept truth burn hell argumentum hominem argumentum hominem literally argument directed man abusive variety argumentum hominem occurs instead trying disprove truth assertion arguer attacks person people making assertion invalid truth assertion depend upon goodness asserting example atheism evil philosophy practised communists murderers sometimes court law doubt cast upon testimony witness showing example known perjurer valid way reducing credibility testimony given witness argumentum hominem however demonstrate witness testimony false conclude otherwise fall victim argumentum ignorantiam see elsewhere list circumstantial form argumentum hominem committed person argues opponent ought accept truth assertion opponent particular circumstances example perfectly acceptable kill animals food argue otherwise quite happy wear leather shoes abusive charge inconsistency used excuse dismissing opponent argument fallacy also used means rejecting conclusion example course would argue positive discrimination bad thing white particular form argumentum hominem one alleges one adversary rationalizing conclusion formed selfish interests also known poisoning well argumentum ignorantium argumentum ignorantium means argument ignorance fallacy occurs whenever argued something must true simply proved false equivalently argued something must false proved true note assuming something false proved true basic scientific principle examples course bible true nobody prove otherwise course telepathy psychic phenomena exist nobody shown proof real note fallacy apply court law one generally assumed innocent proven guilty also scientific investigation known event would produce certain evidence occurred absence evidence validly used infer event occur example flood described bible would require enormous volume water present earth earth tenth much water even count frozen ice poles therefore flood occurred science validly assume lack evidence something occurred conclude certainty occurred however argumentum misericordiam appeal pity also known special pleading fallacy committed arguer appeals pity sake getting conclusion accepted example murder mother father axe please find guilty suffering enough orphan argumentum populum known appealing gallery appealing people commit fallacy attempt win acceptance assertion appealing large group people form fallacy often characterized emotive language example pornography must banned violence women bible must true millions people know trying tell mistaken fools argumentum numeram fallacy closely related argumentum populum consists asserting people support believe proposition likely proposition correct argumentum verecundiam appeal authority uses admiration famous try win support assertion example isaac newton genius believed god line argument always completely bogus example reference admitted authority particular field may relevant discussion subject example distinguish quite clearly stephen hawking concluded black holes give radiation john searle concluded impossible build intelligent computer hawking physicist reasonably expect opinions black hole radiation informed searle linguist questionable whether well qualified speak subject machine intelligence fallacy accident fallacy accident committed general rule applied particular case whose accidental circumstances mean rule inapplicable error made one goes general specific example christians generally dislike atheists christian must dislike atheists fallacy often committed moralists legalists try decide every moral legal question mechanically applying general rules converse accident hasty generalization fallacy reverse fallacy accident occurs one forms general rule examining specific cases representative possible cases example jim bakker insincere christian therefore christians insincere sweeping generalization dicto simpliciter sweeping generalization occurs general rule applied particular situation features particular situation render rule inapplicable sweeping generalization opposite hasty generalization non causa pro causa post hoc ergo propter hoc known false cause fallacies fallacy non causa pro causa occurs one identifies something cause event actually shown cause example took aspirin prayed god headache disappeared god cured headache fallacy post hoc ergo propter hoc occurs something assumed cause event merely happened event example soviet union collapsed taking atheism therefore must avoid atheism reasons cum hoc ergo propter hoc fallacy similar post hoc ergo propter hoc asserts two events occur together must causally related leaves room factors may cause events petitio principii fallacy occurs premises least questionable conclusion reached circulus demonstrando fallacy occurs one assumes premise conclusion one wishes reach often proposition rephrased fallacy appears valid argument example homosexuals must allowed hold government office hence government official revealed homosexual lose job therefore homosexuals anything hide secret open blackmail therefore homosexuals allowed hold government office note argument entirely circular premise conclusion argument like actually cited reason british secret services official ban homosexual employees another example classic know god exists bible tells know bible true word god complex question fallacy interrogation fallacy presupposition one example classic loaded question stopped beating wife question presupposes definite answer another question even asked trick often used lawyers cross examination ask questions like hide money stole similarly politicians often ask loaded questions long interference affairs allowed continue chancellor plan two years ruinous privatization ignoratio elenchi fallacy irrelevant conclusion consists claiming argument supports particular conclusion actually logically nothing conclusion example christian may begin saying argue teachings christianity undoubtably true argues length christianity great help many people matter well argues shown christian teachings true sadly fallacious arguments often successful arouse emotions cause others view supposed conclusion favourable light equivocation equivocation occurs key word used two different meanings argument example could affordable free software make sure remains free users like must place license make sure always freely redistributable amphiboly amphiboly occurs premises used argument ambiguous careless ungrammatical phrasing accent accent another form fallacy shifting meaning case meaning changed altering parts statement emphasized example consider speak ill friends speak ill friends fallacies composition one fallacy composition conclude property shared parts something must apply whole example bicycle made entirely low mass components therefore lightweight fallacy composition conclude property number individual items shared collection items example car uses less petrol causes less pollution bus therefore cars less environmentally damaging buses fallacy division fallacy division opposite fallacy composition like opposite exists two varieties first assume property thing must apply parts example studying rich college therefore must rich assume property collection items shared item example ants destroy tree therefore ant destroy tree slippery slope argument argument states one event occur harmful events proof made harmful events caused first event example legalize marijuana would legalize crack heroin nation full drug addicts welfare therefore legalize marijuana based fallacies type fallacies fallacies occur one attempts argue things way similar without actually specifying way similar examples history based upon faith bible also form history islam based faith christianity based faith islam form christianity cats form animal based carbon chemistry dogs form animal based carbon chemistry dogs form cat affirmation consequent fallacy argument form implies true therefore true understand fallacy examine truth table implication given earlier denial antecedent fallacy argument form implies false therefore false truth table implication makes clear fallacy note fallacy different non causa pro causa latter form implies false therefore false fact imply problem implication invalid rather falseness allow deduce anything converting conditional fallacy argument form therefore argumentum antiquitam fallacy asserting something right good simply old way always argumentum novitam opposite argumentum antiquitam fallacy asserting something correct simply new newer something else argumentum crumenam fallacy believing money criterion correctness money likely right argumentum lazarum fallacy assuming someone poor sounder virtuous one wealthier fallacy opposite argumentum crumenam argumentum nauseam incorrect belief assertion likely true often heard argumentum nauseum one employs constant repetition asserting something bifurcation also referred black white fallacy bifurcation occurs one presents situation two alternatives fact alternatives exist exist plurium interrogationum many questions fallacy occurs questioner demands simple answer complex question non sequitur non sequitur argument conclusion drawn premises logically connected red herring fallacy committed irrelevant material introduced issue discussed everyone attention diverted away points made towards different conclusion reification hypostatization reification occurs abstract concept treated concrete thing shifting burden proof burden proof always person making assertion proposition shifting burden proof special case argumentum ignorantium fallacy putting burden proof person denies questions assertion made source fallacy assumption something true unless proven otherwise straw man straw man fallacy misrepresent someone else position attacked easily knock misrepresented position conclude original position demolished fallacy fails deal actual arguments made extended analogy fallacy extended analogy often occurs suggested general rule argued fallacy assume mentioning two different situations argument general rule constitutes claim situations analogous fallacy best explained using real example debate anti cryptography legislation believe always wrong oppose law breaking position odious implies would supported martin luther king saying cryptography legislation important struggle black liberation dare quoque famous fallacy occurs action argued acceptable party performed instance randomly abusive abusive

nights good book tells jesus crucified ninth hour friday afternoon put grave sometime jesus left grave rose dawn call sunday dawn sabbath means jesus using time clarity grave friday night time sunday morning could also add little time friday since bible specific means using jewish time grave one day two nights possibly couple hours one day certainly problem jesus prediction absolutely way even

ass ass colt command peace nations much difference except zechariah involves one animal ass colt matthew reads poetic wording slightly differently thus jesus call colt adult ass matthew version get comical picture divine christ sweating straddle two donkeys could inevitably lead theological proctological dilemma find account written earlier mark colt called brought jesus indeed fits verses zechariah properly shows matthew attempt use prophetic verses bungled excluding many respectable christians met noticed christ thought ridden asses situation often reversed nowadays entering jerusalem temple priests angered people youngsters calling jesus messiah jesus replied might expect matthew done read mouth babes sucklings thou brought perfect praise likely matthew made response since jesus never one point little prophetic things since might expect quote error seems fit matthew track record quite well might ask jesus matthew read source reads psalms yahweh lord majestic name whole world whose glory chanted heavens babes infants founded bulwark foes still enemy avenger passages hardly need comment perfect praise spoken psalm praise given messiah king jesus mentioned seems one case matthew pen making convenient prophetic scripture yhvh said lord jesus said asked promised jewish messiah king descended jews agree king david jesus counters quoting psalms lord said lord sit right hand put enemies feet taken face value jesus denying necessity davidic descent one assumes opposition answer course christian answer agrees trying make hidden point reveal mystery divine nature messiah king tempting believe one christian interested matters investigation problems jesus time psalm thought messiah easy see david might refer messiah superior need look scriptures messiah see expected great king bringing jews times even better david rule course jews listening good answer passage could indeed refer divine messiah christians worship problem lies meaning psalm error apparently several jews jesus time also made one must remember various factions among jews often result different expectations messiah king jesus apparently one adventists like audience thought

midst foes people offer freely day lead host holy mountains priest order melchizedek forever word lord often mistakenly capitalised christian bibles denote divinity lord hebrew word adoni capitalisation exists adoni simply means lord generic term would use used often scriptures refer kings merely address respect nothing text imply word refers either divinity messiah king supposed

event ends embarrassing pharisees power pen moses jesus together along leave gospel story matthew momentarily see pseudo prophecy john gospel gospel story john deserves special treatment seems far

field told jesus betrayed jerusalem one followers judas iscariot matthew writes throwing pieces silver temple judas departed chief priests taking silver said lawful put treasury since blood money bought potter field bury strangers fulfilled spoken prophet jeremiah took thirty pieces silver price price set sons israel gave potter field lord directed prophecy utterly gross bastardisation old testament scripture first matthew made mistake regarding name prophet zechariah utters verses matthew makes use zech weighed wages thirty shekels silver yhvh said cast treasury lordly price paid took thirty shekels silver cast treasury house yhvh first verses zechariah deal betrayer messiah deal shepherd likely priest chosen serve function presiding people shortly would send judah israel conflict one another word treasury replaced king james scholars potter precisely made matthew quote fit better blatant error correct translation hebrew indeed treasury also makes perfect sense zechariah context whereas potter field totally unrelated whether mistranslation intentional seems beyond speculation however given matthew track record one finds hard resist notion intentional dishonesty course matthew would ample reason altering text thirty pieces silver match judas situation christians seem reader willing disregard contextual incongruity matthew might another prophecy toss around however correct translation zechariah directly contradicts situation judas high priests high priests would put money treasury worthless shepherd zechariah exactly opposite course average thursday night bible student prophecy presented matthew would taken new testament face value matthew work convincing enough wine vinegar casting lots jesus led away crucified gave vinegar drink mingled gall tasted would

soldiers drank regularly find right jesus dies soldiers give drink polluted gall jesus said thirst bowl vinegar stood put sponge full vinegar hyssop held mouth received vinegar said finished matthew seems drawing passage prophets one psalms looked pity none comforters found none gave poison food lit put gall meat thirst gave vinegar drink add punishment upon punishment may acquittal thee let blotted book living course sour wine offered jesus done request drink indeed seem show pity psalm quoted david political military enemies messiah jesus surprising run problem see jesus psalm asks damnation crucifiers whereas jesus gospels says jesus said father forgive know matthew misses attempt create prophecy gall bitter substance put jesus drink meat psalm stipulates prophecy vinegar faulty naturally ask casting lots brings psalm deserves discussion suffice say fact jesus clothes divided told great thing turns happened often felon days soon see perhaps least erroneous passage psalm applied jesus indeed bring interesting question quality jesus clothes man removed worldly possessions ownership clothes worthy casting lots raises suspicions psalm psalm attributed david lament condition attack enemies becomes song praise yhvh hope taken context parts seem fit plight jesus crucifixion quite well examine primary passages verse god god forsaken far helping far words groaning god cry day answer night find rest jesus said cried first sentence cross suggests whole psalm really jesus rather king david course rest first stanza fit nicely jesus execution jesus pictured complaining whole ordeal supposed like lamb led mute shearers indeed jesus much groaning even cross certainly cry day night cross worm man scorned men see mock make faces wag heads committed cause yhvh let deliver delights seems fit jesus execution pretty well exception holy messiah called worm many bulls encompass open mouths widely like ravening roaring lion yea dogs round company evildoers encir cle pierced hands feet see bones divide garments among cast lost raiment yhvh far away deliver soul sword life power dog save mouth lion afflicted soul horns wild bull would seem quite convincing sure early christian fathers wrote prophecy thought unfortunately prophecy fatal flaw words pierced really exist psalm correct hebrew translation yea dogs round company evildoers encircles like lion hands feet hebrew phrase like lion rare verb form mean pierced differ one phonetic character word hebrew text literally like lion ari makes sense context even fits animal imagery employed psalm writer convenience would urge christian change word aru add needed yet artificial weight prophecy christian translators chosen correct translation eliminate psalm referring jesus absence say much honesty translators apart erroneous verse psalm lend jesus easily verse speaks sufferer saved sword rather cross naturally fits psalm true subject king david side note know crucifixions pierce

usually excontexts one passage john errors grossly obvious blatant speak well gospel writers helps show prophetic aspects religion founded reckoned transgressors arrest jesus quickly executed claiming jewish kingship messiahship according one version gospel tale jesus gets executed along two thieves crucified two robbers one right one left scripture fulfilled says reckoned transgressors mark trying link jesus passage isaiah servant nation israel passage messiah one reads whole chapter isaiah surrounding chapters one sees servant nation verses also servant gone past prediction come event servant thought criminal also happens fit description jesus passage really messiah still clear executing jesus two thieves would fulfill prophecy isaiah jesus would fittingly fulfill whole ministry considered blasphemer troublemaker throughout career locking onto single event rather poor way steal prophecy least case see mark could made better analogy general comparisons mark goes tell crucified jesus also reviled expected couple robbers course later recount luke decides change things luke tells one criminals hanged railed messiah save certainly fits mark recount tells people crucified jesus said save robbers luke goes criminal rebuked first saying fear since sentence condemnation indeed justly receiving due reward deeds man done nothing wrong said jesus remember come kingdom jesus answered verily say today paradise little dialogue seems highly contrived stretches imagination bit see picture one ruffian rebuking fellow criminal eloquent speech rather strange picture criminal lamenting goodness
