showed bacterial infection enough background provided help understand make comments sporanox anti fungal therapy first question fungus penetrate little way poor mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without considered systemic classic sense sort inbetween infection concerned toxicity vitamin doctor blood tests put vitamin one week dropped next couple weeks also received zinc supplementation since interrelate fairly complex ways doctor explained one evil orthomolecular specialists blood test three weeks later vitamin normal stopped vitamin except multi vitamin supplement made sure maintain day beta carotene call carrot face hopefully elaine doctor take similar careful approach supplements even reevaluating supplements taking example niacin fairly large dosages gram day steve dyer good information sci med nutrition niacin second order improvement symptomatic relief sinus allergies probably worth taking large dose long term risking liver damage though believe based successful therapy sporanox definitely excessive growth fungus unknown species sinuses still want ask question studies demonstrate candida blooms sinuses associated sinus irritation sinusitis rhinitis sinus irritation reduced significantly one week sporanox new treatments implemented time noticeable track problems starting sporanox days went away considered normal btw doctor dug one medical reference books sorry remember one found obscure comment dating back stated people develop contained non lethal non serious aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis sinuses leading sinus inflammation symptoms dig reference since relevant discussion doctor tested believe rast rast similar test allergic response specificially candida albicans showed strong positive another question would everybody show strong positive test essentially useless assuming true candida grow part way mucus membrane tissue concentration exceeds threshold amount could person tests allergy candida definitely develop allergic symptoms mucus membrane irritation due body allergic response said earlier post one need rocket scientist degree biochemistry see plausibility hypothesis btw repost ivker book sinus survival routinely given anything else nizoral pre sporanox systemic anti fungal safe good sporanox new chronic sinusitis patients antibiotics four times last two years claims patients well notice relief sinus inflammation symptoms cure means implying called yeast fungus infection primary cause later complication also found nystatin whether taken internally put sinus spray help implies

greatly deteriorated course skeptics would say maybe nothing would improved anyway view stretching things quite far experience three ent saw said live confident reach one could call total cure anti fungal program undertook one necessary step direction overuse last four years note sinus problems may suggest book ivker mention sure get revised edition ivker started chronic severe sinus problems visits several ent totally floored said live spent several years trying everything standard non standard essentially cured chronic sinusitis shares approach book honestly say road recovery following parts one recommendation take systemic anti fungal beginning treatment history anti biotic overuse proven time time practice sure commented hard core beliefs anti yeast hypothesis posters would definite things say worked wonders almost two thousand cases put mildly also would surprised would say ones violating moral obligations help patient maybe doctors reading practice confronted patient symptoms could due hypothetical yeast overgrowth fit profiles pro yeast people identified consider anti fungal therapy avenues exhausted remember theory practice two different things one without synergistic doctor something non standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief thousand patients least sit take notice maybe ought trust says begin hypothesizing works instead work afraid lot doctors become enamored scientific correctness ignoring patients sworn help balanced see posters group comes point use little common sense maybe empirical approach trying good systemic anti fungal sporanox exhausted avenues one traditional medical establishment able help natural thing went couple doctor somewhat outside establishment result found significant relief would better traditional medical establishment set kind mechanism doctor without fear sued license pulled try experimental unproven beyond doubt therapies patients finally reach point accepted therapies ineffective like hear doctor tell well tried therapies approved accepted country since clearly work authority use experimental unproven techniques seem helped others promise anything risks sign something saying understand experimental possibly risky nature unproven therapies register case state board anyway ent suggested would jumped pronto instead going one doctors either altruistic reasons greed practicing alternative therapies much risk risk meaning losing license possibly patient mechanism would keep control mainstream medicine also provide valuable data would essentially free also would morally ethically better current system showing compassion medical community patient everything within reason help patient lack mechanism leading large numbers people try alternative therapies seem work like

many weaknesses weaknesses cryptographically secured mail general pertain secure mail programs ripem maintained marc vanheyningen mvanheyn indiana edu posted monthly variety news groups followups pertaining specifically ripem alt security ripem cryptanalysis attacks breaking rsa would allow attacker find private key case could read mail encrypted sign messages private key rsa generally believed resistant standard cryptanalytic techniques even standard key bits ripem long enough render impractical barring huge investment hardware breakthrough factoring breaking des would allow attacker read given message since message encrypted des would allow attacker claim des bits key thus could conceivably compromised brute force sufficient hardware agencies money devote simply read one message since message different des key work message would remain high key management attacks stealing private key would allow benefits breaking rsa safeguard encrypted des key derived passphrase type however attacker get copy private keyfile passphrase snooping network packets tapping lines whatever could break whole scheme main risk transferring either passphrase private key file across untrusted link run ripem trusted machine preferably one sitting right front ideally machine home maybe office nobody else physical access fooling accepting bogus public key someone else could allow opponent deceive sending secret messages rather real recipient enemy fool intended recipient well could encrypt messages bogus public key pass along important get proper public keys people common mechanism finger assuming opponent compromised routers daemons finger given fair amount trust strongest method key authentication exchange keys person however always practical people vouch signing statement containing key possible although ripem features automatically pgp ripem generate check fingerprints public keys key files may exchanged via separate channel authentication playback attacks even opponent break cryptography opponent could still cause difficulties example suppose send message mic pem mode provide disclosure protection alice says let opponent intercepts resends bob message authenticated telling course may interpret entirely different context opponent could transmit message recipient much later figuring would seen differently later time opponent could change originator name register public key send message hoping recipient send return mail indicating perhaps even quoting unknown message defeat playback attacks plaintext message include indication sender recipient unique identifier typically date good front end script ripem automatically imho recipient sure originator name header sender indicated within plaintext really recipient message old one also automated author faq made modest attempt automating process generating checking encapsulated headers programs included standard distribution utils directory local attacks clearly security ripem greater security machine encryption performed example unix super user could manage get encrypted mail although would take planning effort something like replace ripem executable trojan horse get copy plaintext depending stored addition link machine running ripem extension decrypt ripem remote machine connected via network worse yet modem eavesdropper could see plaintext probably also passphrase ripem executed systems trust obviously extreme case ripem used machine total control nobody else access carefully examined software known free viruses however real trade convenience security moderately cautious user might use ripem unix workstation people access even root access increase security keeping private keys statically linked course executable floppy disk people keep ripem multi user system dialing insecure line download message system perform ripem decryption however security provided mechanism somewhat illusory since presumably type cleartext password log given away store since attacker log install traps account steal private key next time use less insecure line likely remain situation long systems use rather quaint mechanism cleartext password authentication find nice put brief statement carefully manage security arrangement plan next public key potential correspondents aware level precautions place people use two keys short one carefully managed ordinary use longer one treated greater care critical correspondence untrusted partner attacks ripem encryption ensure person private key corresponding public key used encrypt data may read traffic however someone key gets message may always make whatever kind transformations wishes exist cryptographic barriers recipient say taking encrypted message converting mic message signed readable anyone although ripem provide functionality indeed latest pem draft seen specifically states transformations possible allow forwarding functions work
