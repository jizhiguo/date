tape errors problem might caused defective hardware however heard people similar problems mentioning case hardware problem tape backups restores take long time floppy controller based tape backup device may adjust adaptec bus timing best results using tape drive normally tape backup restore tape drive motor continuously running occasional pause however default bus timing adaptec may cause tape drive motor start stop start stop every seconds causes needless wear tape tape drive however note dirty tape head defective tape drive also cause make sure tape heads clean also causes tape backup restore take much much longer necessary problem tape backups use floppy dma transfer data memory tape drive adaptec uses dma transfer data memory hard disk floppy dma needs feed data tape drive certain rate tape drive fed data quickly enough floppy dma tape drive stops rewinds bit restarts enough data eventually fed default bus timing adaptec really dma timing large example backup done data transferred hard disk memory memory tape default timing adaptec hogs memory much much time spent transferring data hard disk memory enough time spent transferring data memory tape drive result tape drive constantly starts stops data fed quickly enough solution change adaptec bus timing default factory setting microseconds microseconds bus timing needs lowered microseconds done one two ways aspidos use option example use bus timing microseconds means use following line config sys file device aspidos sys note space aspidos recourse try find program called setscsi exe difficult find reason adaptec reasons seem want widely distributed asked someone worked adaptec asked upload anywhere anonymous ftp access internet could try using archie hunt copy believe couple sites find copy run like setscsi adjusts bus timing microseconds running setscsi exe without arguments resets bus timing back factory defaults note seems use setscsi exe use aspidos setscsi exe crashed system aspidos loaded could use setscsi exe scsiha sys however lower bus timing microseconds increase microseconds lower low hard disk throughput suddenly drop system feel slower microseconds works fine value may work fine may adjust downwards little lowered bus timing tape backups restores run faster also experiment bus times options intentionally described unless know bad combinations cause parity errors worse starving memory refresh program called bustifix exe exists adaptec bbs unless upgraded since last checked self extracting archive containing batch file couple files batch file supposed allow one set bus times others however tried running program system crashed time running scsiha sys check see conflict maybe old program works although docs say works erratic tape operations many tape errors problem may may exist although existed system hardware problem particular could cause however heard people similar problems mentioning case hardware problem symptoms problem persists even cleaning tape head backing tape encounters unusable sector detected errors resulting aborted tape backup tape backup works tape compare fails tape drive starts stops starts stops etc much often unlike mentioned problem tape backups restores take long time tape drive starts stops every seconds kind starting stopping occurs every seconds fastback plus find see tape backup devices programs like central point backup cms jumbo software assuming cms jumbo tape drive find see tape drive fastback plus many tape read errors although know causing problem discovered using different floppy controller solves months ago upgraded motherboard contained integrated floppy controller already floppy controller initially disabled motherboard floppy controller decided try disabling floppy controller using one motherboard tape drive cms jumbo reliability increased dramatically fastback plus suddenly able find use tape drive know caused hardware problem one hand floppy drives worked great attached seems say nothing wrong hand tape drive work well attached floppy controller work attached different controller could indication hardware problem change floppy drive cables conceivable problem cables know cause really however similar problems might want consider trying new floppy controller sound cards many popular sound cards play record digitized sound typically done using dma like tape drive dma adaptec dma conflict sound card dma unlike tape dma conflict usually manifests parity error system crashes parity error message happens data transferred quickly sound card adaptec memory refresh occur quickly enough causes parity error usually getting parity error means hardware problem system case however parity error symptom bad hardware found parity errors typically occur recording digitized sound chances errors increase increase recording fidelity higher sampling rate recording stereo recording using bits instead etc like tape drive solution solution lower adaptec bus timing see section tape drives information done note however may may solve problem may reduce probability parity error software used record digitized sound greatly affect problem software inefficient disk caches speed

easier maintain usable fewer resources stored server resource manager property side benefit server may start fractionally quicker since load resources applications process resources never sort

resource database need run application without xrdb xrdb default run xdefaults file cpp resources split multiple resource files loaded individual client programs watch style comments xdefaults file cpp stripped switched method distributed resource files spent several frustrating days trying figure clients finding resources provide error message encountered style comments resource files simply

full color format converting color jpeg image display bit less hardware requires color quantization true color jpegs even feed less color gif jpeg comes decompressor colors thousands colors happens
