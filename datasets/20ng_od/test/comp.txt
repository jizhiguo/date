hello week one half ago posted query looking people feelings inkjet family printers specifically comparison canon bubblejet hewlett packard deskjet many people asked post summary account postings mail received original query responses received deleted part responses headers signatures extract find necessary people asked unbiased account however nature question suggests favoritism biased comments must extract information believe unbiased fair representation printer wide range comments value clear winner like especially price performance ratio others preferred durability reliability deskjet original inkjet proven drivers solid background two new inkjet printers drawn attention new printer introduced hewlett packard later year around summertime addition epson product line first inkjet find initial purchase costs filling replacing ink cartridges largely depends purchase fills replacements shop around first since aspect likely dominate cost printer one mentioned approx many sheets ink cartridge print suspect roughly equal sheets laser printers sheets per toner cartridge well brief research summary personal research enjoy well bought month ago start rebate program printer ends bought computer discount warehouse price beat anywhere looked think hot printer using regular copier paper produced fantastic results high quality mode compared output micrografx designer legal size drawing type done drawing printed laserjet iid amazed well could read small print printing speed several seconds faster amazing considering ram installed measured time printer first indicated receiving data used print manager windows showed output several people work one manager bought one immediately office two engineers placed orders need cdw phone number delivery two days good luck craig witkowski ceng maccvm corp mot com motorola communications electronics inc glen rock deskjet performance spectacular windows using truetype fonts neither canon seen quality much dependent paper

graphics bmp images etc put dither mode via supplied win driver number dither options scatter pattern etc manual gives recommendations depending type image printed text good mode problem arises document contains graphic text range tones graphic images brilliant think limitation inkjet printers general however printer definitely worth looking new inkjet epson printer faster cheaper capable producing laser like quality normal copier paper remember model something think purchased days epson released introductory price epson new zealand month ago got canon absolutely love incredibly fast except printing pspice know ever stuff stuff print either microsoft word windows plain text problems printing headers footers printer freaked printing cheap paper lots streaks normal copy paper works great tell laser printed holding less twelve inches face nearsighted like printer comes driver windows complaints printer also act like epson another archaic software packages written driver yet teeny weeny footprint real plus purchase may get rebate canon bought mine store called compusa price friend looking also prints well everyone drivers slow hope helped dpi sure looks great heather stehman guess experience work deskjet home prefer deskjet printing speed quality similar tested text graphics buying deskjet home feature sets deskjet apart driver support many applications ends emulating

thought points posted note deskjet unprintable area approximately inch around paper bubblejet right graphics resolutions tested printers applications access wordperfect harvard graphics wingif paintshop pro paintbrush could tell difference fact one deskjet windows drivers gives significant control contrast density printer hence controlling amount ink put bubblejet imaging software test printers comparision finally wanted sheet feeding configuration bubblejet cost approximately deskjet went pretty thorough evaluation chose deskjet spent money btw replacing deskjet work month anyway regards mike mattix group monsanto luling spent time comparing two ended getting bubblejet versus reasons seemed worse banding canon dpi versus felt could see difference price canon rebate program going moment choice could pages feeder holds pages think see pages done anything big performance seems reasonable windows know microsoft bbs newer windows driver comes printer know compares also

decompression would nice compressed image jpeg could decompress manipulate crop border say recompress without image degradation beyond lost initially unfortunately case general recompressing altered image loses information though usually much lost first time around next best thing would decompress image recompress without changing loss get identical jpeg file even true least current free jpeg software essentially problem accumulation roundoff error repeatedly compress decompress image eventually degrade see visible changes first generation output usually takes many cycles get visible change one things list see accumulation error avoided limited optimistic case could possibly guaranteed would compressing unmodified full color output djpeg original quality setting would introduce loss even simple changes cropping border could cause roundoff error degradation wondering pixel block boundaries move cropped multiples pixels might safe mighty limited capability bottom line jpeg useful format archival storage transmission images want use intermediate format sequences image manipulation steps use lossless format ppm rle tiff etc working image jpeg ready file away aside avoiding degradation save lot compression decompression time way rules thumb converting gif images jpeg stated earlier lose amount image information convert existing gif image jpeg obtain original full color data gif made far better make jpeg need save space gif work suggestions getting maximum space savings minimum loss quality first rule converting gif library look jpeg make sure happy throwing away corresponding gif give chance conversion higher quality setting necessary gifs may better left gifs explained section particular cartoon type gifs sixteen fewer colors convert well may find jpeg file reasonable quality larger gif check sizes experience date suggests large high visual quality gifs best candidates conversion jpeg chew storage offer potential savings convert jpeg least degradation waste time converting gif much kbytes also expect jpeg files converted gifs small created directly full color originals maintain image quality may let converted files much twice big straight jpeg files would shoot size gif file suggested earlier comparisons many people developed odd habit putting large constant color border around gif image useless nearly free terms storage cost gif files free jpeg files sharp border boundary create visible artifacts ghost edges favor crop border jpeging windows system manual automatic cropping functions painless way cjpeg default setting appropriate full color input gif inputs settings often seem necessary avoid image degradation apply smoothing suggested higher setting may necessary color gifs photographs complex artwork usually dithered fool eye seeing colors gif actually store enlarge image see adjacent pixels often significantly different colors normal size eye averages pixels together produce illusion intermediate color value trouble dithering jpeg looks like high spatial frequency color noise jpeg compress noise well resulting jpeg file larger lower image quality would gotten jpeging original full color image get around want smooth gif image compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating color thought saw anyway process getting rid rapid color changes give jpeg trouble appropriate use smoothing often let avoid using high factor thus reducing size compressed file still obtaining better looking output image get without smoothing free jpeg software products based simple smoothing capability built try smooth converting gifs values seem work well high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors see regular fine scale patterns gif image even without enlargement strong smoothing definitely called large smoothing factor blur output image want image processing wizard also smoothing separate filtering program pnmconvol pbmplus package however cjpeg
