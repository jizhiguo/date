hello week one half ago posted query looking people feelings inkjet family printers specifically comparison canon bubblejet hewlett packard deskjet many people asked post summary account postings mail received original query responses received deleted part responses headers signatures extract find necessary people asked unbiased account however nature question suggests favoritism biased comments must extract information believe unbiased fair representation printer wide range comments value clear winner like especially price performance ratio others preferred durability reliability deskjet original inkjet proven drivers solid background two new inkjet printers drawn attention new printer introduced hewlett packard later year around summertime addition epson product line first inkjet find initial purchase costs filling replacing ink cartridges largely depends purchase fills replacements shop around first since aspect likely dominate cost printer one mentioned approx many sheets ink cartridge print suspect roughly equal sheets laser printers sheets per toner cartridge well brief research summary personal research enjoy well bought month ago start rebate program printer ends bought computer discount warehouse price beat anywhere looked think hot printer using regular copier paper produced fantastic results high quality mode compared output micrografx designer legal size drawing type done drawing printed laserjet iid amazed well could read small print printing speed several seconds faster amazing considering ram installed measured time printer first indicated receiving data used print manager windows showed output several people work one manager bought one immediately office two engineers placed orders need cdw phone number delivery two days good luck craig witkowski ceng maccvm corp mot com motorola communications electronics inc glen rock deskjet performance spectacular windows using truetype fonts neither canon seen quality much dependent paper

graphics bmp images etc put dither mode via supplied win driver number dither options scatter pattern etc manual gives recommendations depending type image printed text good mode problem arises document contains graphic text range tones graphic images brilliant think limitation inkjet printers general however printer definitely worth looking new inkjet epson printer faster cheaper capable producing laser like quality normal copier paper remember model something think purchased days epson released introductory price epson new zealand month ago got canon absolutely love incredibly fast except printing pspice know ever stuff stuff print either microsoft word windows plain text problems printing headers footers printer freaked printing cheap paper lots streaks normal copy paper works great tell laser printed holding less twelve inches face nearsighted like printer comes driver windows complaints printer also act like epson another archaic software packages written driver yet teeny weeny footprint real plus purchase may get rebate canon bought mine store called compusa price friend looking also prints well everyone drivers slow hope helped dpi sure looks great heather stehman guess experience work deskjet home prefer deskjet printing speed quality similar tested text graphics buying deskjet home feature sets deskjet apart driver support many applications ends emulating

thought points posted note deskjet unprintable area approximately inch around paper bubblejet right graphics resolutions tested printers applications access wordperfect harvard graphics wingif paintshop pro paintbrush could tell difference fact one deskjet windows drivers gives significant control contrast density printer hence controlling amount ink put bubblejet imaging software test printers comparision finally wanted sheet feeding configuration bubblejet cost approximately deskjet went pretty thorough evaluation chose deskjet spent money btw replacing deskjet work month anyway regards mike mattix group monsanto luling spent time comparing two ended getting bubblejet versus reasons seemed worse banding canon dpi versus felt could see difference price canon rebate program going moment choice could pages feeder holds pages think see pages done anything big performance seems reasonable windows know microsoft bbs newer windows driver comes printer know compares also

decompression would nice compressed image jpeg could decompress manipulate crop border say recompress without image degradation beyond lost initially unfortunately case general recompressing altered image loses information though usually much lost first time around next best thing would decompress image recompress without changing loss get identical jpeg file even true least current free jpeg software essentially problem accumulation roundoff error repeatedly compress decompress image eventually degrade see visible changes first generation output usually takes many cycles get visible change one things list see accumulation error avoided limited optimistic case could possibly guaranteed would compressing unmodified full color output djpeg original quality setting would introduce loss even simple changes cropping border could cause roundoff error degradation wondering pixel block boundaries move cropped multiples pixels might safe mighty limited capability bottom line jpeg useful format archival storage transmission images want use intermediate format sequences image manipulation steps use lossless format ppm rle tiff etc working image jpeg ready file away aside avoiding degradation save lot compression decompression time way rules thumb converting gif images jpeg stated earlier lose amount image information convert existing gif image jpeg obtain original full color data gif made far better make jpeg need save space gif work suggestions getting maximum space savings minimum loss quality first rule converting gif library look jpeg make sure happy throwing away corresponding gif give chance conversion higher quality setting necessary gifs may better left gifs explained section particular cartoon type gifs sixteen fewer colors convert well may find jpeg file reasonable quality larger gif check sizes experience date suggests large high visual quality gifs best candidates conversion jpeg chew storage offer potential savings convert jpeg least degradation waste time converting gif much kbytes also expect jpeg files converted gifs small created directly full color originals maintain image quality may let converted files much twice big straight jpeg files would shoot size gif file suggested earlier comparisons many people developed odd habit putting large constant color border around gif image useless nearly free terms storage cost gif files free jpeg files sharp border boundary create visible artifacts ghost edges favor crop border jpeging windows system manual automatic cropping functions painless way cjpeg default setting appropriate full color input gif inputs settings often seem necessary avoid image degradation apply smoothing suggested higher setting may necessary color gifs photographs complex artwork usually dithered fool eye seeing colors gif actually store enlarge image see adjacent pixels often significantly different colors normal size eye averages pixels together produce illusion intermediate color value trouble dithering jpeg looks like high spatial frequency color noise jpeg compress noise well resulting jpeg file larger lower image quality would gotten jpeging original full color image get around want smooth gif image compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating color thought saw anyway process getting rid rapid color changes give jpeg trouble appropriate use smoothing often let avoid using high factor thus reducing size compressed file still obtaining better looking output image get without smoothing free jpeg software products based simple smoothing capability built try smooth converting gifs values seem work well high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors see regular fine scale patterns gif image even without enlargement strong smoothing definitely called large smoothing factor blur output image want image processing wizard also smoothing separate filtering program pnmconvol pbmplus package however cjpeg

liberal groups paper going use homosexual meaning person engaging sexual acts another sex heard biblical argument person homosexual orientation remains celebate think people admit predisposition

christians believe homosexuality least genital sex wrong however denominations accept metropolitan community churches best known formed specifically accept homosexuals however united church christ also allows think couple groups may well episcopal church seems accept areas others churches congregational government find congregations accept even among southern baptists though number probably one two congregations unusual churches permit homosexual church leaders carefully enforce another issue doubt homosexual pastors every denomination open others arguments biblical issues attempt summarize issues commonly cited reference favoring acceptance homosexuality previous discussions john boswell christianity social tolerance homosexuality chicago press argument pretty clear several explicit laws leviticus rom paul seems pretty negative homosexuality beyond references debates passages often cited subject probably relevant sin inhabitants sodom proposed carry homosexual rape homosexual activity consenting adults even question whether homosexual since entities involved angels particularly horrifying involved guests responsibility towards guests culture strong probably reason lot offered daughter better give daughter allow guests attacked look concordance references sodom elsewhere bible see seem imply homosexuality sin jewish interpretive tradition major sin abuse guests rate debate homosexual rape wrong discuss leviticus law part set laws christians consider binding unless justification found lev alone would settle issue references paul letters number references paul lists sins words fairly vague boswell argues words occuring lists lists cor tim malakos arsenokoitai unfortunately entirely clear words actually mean malakos basic meaning soft variety metaphorical meanings ethical writing boswell suggests wanton likely equivalent also reports unanimous interpretation church including greek speaking christians passage referred masturbation meaning vanished cent practice come less frowned upon cites references late edition catholic encyclopedia identify masturbation translates arsenokotai male prostitute giving evidence none church fathers understood term referring homosexuality general technical meaning suggested early latin translations would active mode homosexual male prostitute view paul intend technically conservative view consulted gordon fee commentary cor cites evidence malakos often meant effeminate however boswell warns greek culture effeminate necessarily synonymous homosexual though may associated kinds homosexual behavior given boswell fee say taken together suspect term simply definite applies homosexuals cases general term homosexuality fee argues boswell arsenokotai well ends suggesting translation seems essentially big problem word almost never used paul writing first occurence fact word clearly composed male unfortunately quite tell meaning since tell whether male subject object action examples compound words formed either way given theory could refer rapists etc dangerous base meaning purely etymology conclude goodbye religious expression based god however since boswell fee niv seem agree homosexual male prostitute seems good guess note translation misses strong vulgarity term however something fee boswell agree attempt reproduce translation opinion strongest reference homosexuality romans boswell points rom speaks homosexuality something happened people naturally heterosexual result corruption due worshipping false gods one could argue simply example homosexual worshipped false gods would also fall degradation perhaps become heterosexual however find argument somewhat forced fact homosexual readers seriously proposed paul meant however convinced rom sufficient create law homosexuality christians paul describing rom homosexuality among christians homosexuality appeared among idolaters one part whole package wickedness despite impression left impassioned rhetoric sure paul believe pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex given description situation rather assume heterosexual sex would also debased shameless yes believe passage indicates negative view homosexuality fairness shameless nature acts reflection general spiritual state people specific feature homosexuality overall view situation following think enough evidence confident paul disapproved homosexuality rom seems clear cor tim unambiguous general condemnations homosexuality seem like wording would come someone approved homosexuality even considered acceptable cases hand none passages contains explicit teachings subject rom really idolatry refers homosexuality passing result situation people interpret passages light general approach scripture look scripture laws issues surprising would consider passages endorsement prohibition whose approach bible liberal surprising regard paul negative view homosexuality something took jewish upbringing without serious reexamination light gospel readers group know assumptions behind approaches radically different people tend foam mouth see opposing view described lot moderator situation number discussions past centered around sort detailed exegesis texts described however fact convinced defenders homosexuality actually base beliefs analyses real issue seems rest question whether paul judgement apply modern homosexuality one commonly made claim paul simply never faced kinds questions trying deal encountered homosexuality contexts people would probably agree wrong never faced experience christians try act straight fail never faced christians trying define christian homosexuality fits general christian ideals fidelity seeing sexuality mirror relationship god man unfair take paul judgement homosexuality among idolaters use make judgements questions another following paul time homosexuality associated number things christians would find acceptable part temple prostitution among private citizens often occured adults children free people slaves position say always reasons think ancients distinguished active passive partner considered disgraceful free adult act passive partner reason active mode homosexual prostitute would considered disgraceful customers would people enjoyed passive role supports idea would tend engaged two free adult males least without degree scandal clearly christian homosexuals would condone sex children slaves others position fully responsible partners however fee commentary cor cites examples ancient literature homosexual relationships seem involve free adults reasonably symmetrical way thus considerations paragraph pushed far homosexuality may discredited jews associations surely must cases prostitutes involve slaves children people argued aids judgement homosexuality like point aids transmitted promiscuous sex homosexual heterosexual someone homosexual relationship meets christian criteria marriage risk aids note good reason paul general approach doubt would concede homosexuality fully equal alternative apart specific statements homosexuality believe use genesis story would lead regard heterosexual marriage god ordained however way paul deals pastoral questions provides

principle pastoral issues look carefully good people involved avoid insisting perfection would personally damaging example paul clearly believed acceptable eat meat wanted avoid pushing people action personal qualms another example paul obviously would preferred see people least circumstances remain unmarried yet unable certainly would rather see married state might tempted fornication believe one

excluded church nothing say requirement life long celibacy paul recognized though different context demand practical people think history clerical celibacy strongly reinforced judgement practical result homosexuals end gay sex clubs rest sordid side homosexuality maybe homosexuality god original ideal well imagine paul preferring see people long term committed christian relationships promiscuity work genesis suggests part god original ideal either think relationships still vehicle people sharing god love issue biblical interpretation underlying discussion issue cultural relativism paul says something wrong taken eternal statement things wrong specific situations culture time conservative christians generally insist taking prohibitions absolute since otherwise bible becomes subjective stop considering everything relative looking issue worth noting one completely rejects concept cultural relativism number judgements new testament even conservative christians consider

swearing oaths endorsement slavery institution judgement tax collectors sinner regard items binding cases believe argument essentially one cultural relativism briefly prohibition interest appropriate

anyone check let restrict christians want find commandments books regarded scripture going pass psychologizing answers whether dismissive open kind issue deal question theological point involved quoted often enough believe take seriously jesus said said love obey commands john like christian slave christ wills also instead younger brother still direction though call god abba christians therefore try find lord commands discovering feel obligated confess failure readers may set aside theologizing jargon slaves christ point adherents religion read texts whether classified inspired held models effort find application situations practice ranges devotional reading sermons like exegesis canon ical scripture word god highest pitch leads question whether find inspired scripture something act absolute guidance actions problem finding lord commands going set aside essay one major direction christians looked commands namely christian tradition reject tradition primary audience essay protestants deny tradition determinative value favor witness scripture question want deal commandments find lord scripture turns hard question protestant inquisitors would like turn discussion authority tradition accomodate unlike protestants episcopalians admit claims scripture reason tradition roughly equal standing earlier john quote read john give new commandment love one another place christians given explicit commandment context commenting imperative mode pronouncement jesus meal readers infer since john synoptics jesus says take bread body mark matthew luke corinthians mode imperative greek labete hence commandment cases infer command directed wider circle immediate collocation disciples judge evangelist point mentioning disciples mostly entirely dead expected follow commandment lord case communion paul mention least probably true evangelists also implies ongoing ritual liturgy words operate bind christians original command disciples continuing commandment christian community entirely comfortable inference must point occasion jesus spoke command take clear inference least evangelist notion christians called love one another jesus command directed disciples call attention inference command apply without generalization specific context statement context disciple christ reading scripture make inferences get sense text whatsoever general problem reading texts read without understanding native languages normally read translated texts without appreciation original context points original languages english misleads going presume follows general problem read scripture control really think true suffice current purposes address issues arise already coped understanding year old text another world one live questions level introduce reser vations commandments issue found stipulating read texts original audience might done among reasons seeing john agapate allelou general commandment merely instruction jesus disciples one occasion one linking synoptic great commandment criticism jesus limiting love congenially associate matthew read learnt say love enemies fact leviticus context quoted say hate enemy merely common human presumption leviticus pains say love extend strangers amongst people israel luke expanding context goes jesus say even sinners love love suggests quite strongly say limiting scope new commandment quite jesus mind short inference leads generalizing actual text command force christians objects limited christians trickier agapate allelou institution communion case great commission matthew mark twelve sent evangelize proclaim kingdom heaven close hand verb imperative russete context rather specific twelve specifiers turn steps pagan territory enter samaritan town lukan parallels even specific jesus final journey jerusalem make harder see generalizing christians previous examples prevented christians making inference call attention inference justified text unlike first two cases cite rhetoric evangelist urged reader still paul seems felt obliged proclaim kingdom heaven close hand even contrary jesus instructions gentiles ends earth christians also taken commandment sense john accept know surely rather speculative see ripples inference spread text pretext christians may infer general commandment applicable presented gospels specific occasion necessarily object kind generalization insist people make must understanding reasoning considerable length actually scripture assumptions involved reasoning scriptural though people best justify assumptions references scripture simply adds inference mix let move great commandment love god whole hearts minds souls perhaps synoptic equivalent john agapate allelou yet presented commandment texts rather context controversy pharisees cite matthew pharisees heard silenced sadducees got together disconcert one put question master greatest commandment law means obvious though accept jesus answer meant commandment christians answering polemic enemies mark account casts answer far positive light scribe version says far important holocaust need point word originates context animal sacrifice forget nazis sacrifice luke intermediate lawyer posing question disconcert jesus gets good samarian parable pains luke contexts confusingly various one could forgiven drawing inferences account said obviously taken commandment binding christians though think entirely reasonable conclusion case jesus thinks point mental gears grind cycle get conclusion commanded jesus contingent understanding point jesus use torah quite different gospel accounts application context different contexts among synoptics curious noted luke get fixing command parable good samaritan may look analogous intent matthew gives golden rule meaning law prophets may also hear echo hillel saying generation jesus make associations think entirely reasonable indulging inference texts explicitly support rather read texts kind inter relationship current literary theory calls intertextuality discussion agapate allelou apply beyond community disciples beyound circle christian believers applies buttress conclusion despite presentation saying explicitly commandment christians christians would disagree conclusions must point conclusions depend rather elaborate chains reasoning simply present texts contextual problem keeps coming severely look sayings jesus universally taken christians commandments get really hard cases take divorce mark pretty clear man divorces wife marries another guilty adultery luke except matthew escape clause except case fornication seems rather clear commandment whether take matthew reservation christians day take least practice rather peculiar jesus explicit whereas says nothing things people gnash teeth possible commands christ clear matthew disagree evangelists synoptic tradition going continue examination ever murkier waters enough start theme finding commandments scripture exercise inference inferences informed assumptions cultural biases far identified commandments generally accepted christians yet already difficulties start surface difficulties want discuss next essay topic divorce commandment
