hello week one half ago posted query looking people feelings inkjet family printers specifically comparison canon bubblejet hewlett packard deskjet many people asked post summary account postings mail received original query responses received deleted part responses headers signatures extract find necessary people asked unbiased account however nature question suggests favoritism biased comments must extract information believe unbiased fair representation printer wide range comments value clear winner like especially price performance ratio others preferred durability reliability deskjet original inkjet proven drivers solid background two new inkjet printers drawn attention new printer introduced hewlett packard later year around summertime addition epson product line first inkjet find initial purchase costs filling replacing ink cartridges largely depends purchase fills replacements shop around first since aspect likely dominate cost printer one mentioned approx many sheets ink cartridge print suspect roughly equal sheets laser printers sheets per toner cartridge well brief research summary personal research enjoy well bought month ago start rebate program printer ends bought computer discount warehouse price beat anywhere looked think hot printer using regular copier paper produced fantastic results high quality mode compared output micrografx designer legal size drawing type done drawing printed laserjet iid amazed well could read small print printing speed several seconds faster amazing considering ram installed measured time printer first indicated receiving data used print manager windows showed output several people work one manager bought one immediately office two engineers placed orders need cdw phone number delivery two days good luck craig witkowski ceng maccvm corp mot com motorola communications electronics inc glen rock deskjet performance spectacular windows using truetype fonts neither canon seen quality much dependent paper

graphics bmp images etc put dither mode via supplied win driver number dither options scatter pattern etc manual gives recommendations depending type image printed text good mode problem arises document contains graphic text range tones graphic images brilliant think limitation inkjet printers general however printer definitely worth looking new inkjet epson printer faster cheaper capable producing laser like quality normal copier paper remember model something think purchased days epson released introductory price epson new zealand month ago got canon absolutely love incredibly fast except printing pspice know ever stuff stuff print either microsoft word windows plain text problems printing headers footers printer freaked printing cheap paper lots streaks normal copy paper works great tell laser printed holding less twelve inches face nearsighted like printer comes driver windows complaints printer also act like epson another archaic software packages written driver yet teeny weeny footprint real plus purchase may get rebate canon bought mine store called compusa price friend looking also prints well everyone drivers slow hope helped dpi sure looks great heather stehman guess experience work deskjet home prefer deskjet printing speed quality similar tested text graphics buying deskjet home feature sets deskjet apart driver support many applications ends emulating

thought points posted note deskjet unprintable area approximately inch around paper bubblejet right graphics resolutions tested printers applications access wordperfect harvard graphics wingif paintshop pro paintbrush could tell difference fact one deskjet windows drivers gives significant control contrast density printer hence controlling amount ink put bubblejet imaging software test printers comparision finally wanted sheet feeding configuration bubblejet cost approximately deskjet went pretty thorough evaluation chose deskjet spent money btw replacing deskjet work month anyway regards mike mattix group monsanto luling spent time comparing two ended getting bubblejet versus reasons seemed worse banding canon dpi versus felt could see difference price canon rebate program going moment choice could pages feeder holds pages think see pages done anything big performance seems reasonable windows know microsoft bbs newer windows driver comes printer know compares also

decompression would nice compressed image jpeg could decompress manipulate crop border say recompress without image degradation beyond lost initially unfortunately case general recompressing altered image loses information though usually much lost first time around next best thing would decompress image recompress without changing loss get identical jpeg file even true least current free jpeg software essentially problem accumulation roundoff error repeatedly compress decompress image eventually degrade see visible changes first generation output usually takes many cycles get visible change one things list see accumulation error avoided limited optimistic case could possibly guaranteed would compressing unmodified full color output djpeg original quality setting would introduce loss even simple changes cropping border could cause roundoff error degradation wondering pixel block boundaries move cropped multiples pixels might safe mighty limited capability bottom line jpeg useful format archival storage transmission images want use intermediate format sequences image manipulation steps use lossless format ppm rle tiff etc working image jpeg ready file away aside avoiding degradation save lot compression decompression time way rules thumb converting gif images jpeg stated earlier lose amount image information convert existing gif image jpeg obtain original full color data gif made far better make jpeg need save space gif work suggestions getting maximum space savings minimum loss quality first rule converting gif library look jpeg make sure happy throwing away corresponding gif give chance conversion higher quality setting necessary gifs may better left gifs explained section particular cartoon type gifs sixteen fewer colors convert well may find jpeg file reasonable quality larger gif check sizes experience date suggests large high visual quality gifs best candidates conversion jpeg chew storage offer potential savings convert jpeg least degradation waste time converting gif much kbytes also expect jpeg files converted gifs small created directly full color originals maintain image quality may let converted files much twice big straight jpeg files would shoot size gif file suggested earlier comparisons many people developed odd habit putting large constant color border around gif image useless nearly free terms storage cost gif files free jpeg files sharp border boundary create visible artifacts ghost edges favor crop border jpeging windows system manual automatic cropping functions painless way cjpeg default setting appropriate full color input gif inputs settings often seem necessary avoid image degradation apply smoothing suggested higher setting may necessary color gifs photographs complex artwork usually dithered fool eye seeing colors gif actually store enlarge image see adjacent pixels often significantly different colors normal size eye averages pixels together produce illusion intermediate color value trouble dithering jpeg looks like high spatial frequency color noise jpeg compress noise well resulting jpeg file larger lower image quality would gotten jpeging original full color image get around want smooth gif image compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating color thought saw anyway process getting rid rapid color changes give jpeg trouble appropriate use smoothing often let avoid using high factor thus reducing size compressed file still obtaining better looking output image get without smoothing free jpeg software products based simple smoothing capability built try smooth converting gifs values seem work well high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors see regular fine scale patterns gif image even without enlargement strong smoothing definitely called large smoothing factor blur output image want image processing wizard also smoothing separate filtering program pnmconvol pbmplus package however cjpeg

frequently asked question post question time occurs rather attempt summarize postings get discussion summarizes arguments allowing christian homosexuality since people asking question already know arguments common question dealt herein christian justify homosexual given bible says first definition homosexual many groups believe homosexual orientation sexual attraction members sex distinguished actual homosexual sexual activity homosexuals abstain sex considered groups acceptable however lot discussion term homosexual means someone actually engaging homosexual sex generally accepted outside liberal groups paper going use homosexual meaning person engaging sexual acts another sex heard biblical argument person homosexual orientation remains celebate think people admit predisposition homosexual often called homosexual orientation known whether genetic environmental evidence suggesting best evidence seen homosexuality single phenomenon number different causes one probably genetic several groups try help people move homosexual heterosexual best known exodus international reports seen read detailed literature summary minority opinion presbyterian church infamous report human sexuality suggest programs low success rates questions real even successes certainly people say converted however issue important sounds believe homosexuality wrong believe intrinsically wrong defined god fact hard get homosexual relevant fact hard escape drug addict wrong wrong may affect deal people though difficult change may tend make willing forgive one general background issue common quote

season promoting book allegedly refutes kinsey study scholarly world seems take kook seen objections kinsey study enough detail include someone would like contribute another view willing include christians believe homosexuality least genital sex wrong however denominations accept metropolitan community churches best known formed specifically accept homosexuals however united church christ also allows think couple groups may well episcopal church seems accept areas others churches congregational government find congregations accept even among southern baptists though number probably one two congregations unusual churches permit homosexual church leaders carefully enforce another issue doubt homosexual pastors every denomination open others arguments biblical issues attempt summarize issues commonly cited reference favoring acceptance homosexuality previous discussions john boswell christianity social tolerance homosexuality chicago press argument pretty clear several explicit laws leviticus rom paul seems pretty negative homosexuality beyond references debates passages often cited subject probably relevant sin inhabitants sodom proposed carry homosexual rape homosexual activity consenting adults even question whether homosexual since entities involved angels particularly horrifying involved guests responsibility towards guests culture strong probably reason lot offered daughter better give daughter allow guests attacked look concordance references sodom elsewhere bible see seem imply homosexuality sin jewish interpretive tradition major sin abuse guests rate debate homosexual rape wrong discuss leviticus law part set laws christians consider binding unless justification found lev alone would settle issue references paul letters number references paul lists sins words fairly vague boswell argues words occuring lists lists cor tim malakos arsenokoitai unfortunately entirely clear words actually mean malakos basic meaning soft variety metaphorical meanings ethical writing boswell suggests wanton likely equivalent also reports unanimous interpretation church including greek speaking christians passage referred masturbation meaning vanished cent practice come less frowned upon cites references late edition catholic encyclopedia identify masturbation translates arsenokotai male prostitute giving evidence none church fathers understood term referring homosexuality general technical meaning suggested early latin translations would active mode homosexual male prostitute view paul intend technically conservative view consulted gordon fee commentary cor cites evidence malakos often meant effeminate however boswell warns greek culture effeminate necessarily synonymous homosexual though may associated kinds homosexual behavior given boswell fee say taken together suspect term simply definite applies homosexuals cases general term homosexuality fee argues boswell arsenokotai well ends suggesting translation seems essentially big problem word almost never used paul writing first occurence fact word clearly composed male unfortunately quite tell meaning since tell whether male subject object action examples compound words formed either way given theory could refer rapists etc dangerous base meaning purely etymology conclude goodbye religious expression based god however since boswell fee niv seem agree homosexual male prostitute seems good guess note translation misses strong vulgarity term however something fee boswell agree attempt reproduce translation opinion strongest reference homosexuality romans boswell points rom speaks homosexuality something happened people naturally heterosexual result corruption due worshipping false gods one could argue simply example homosexual worshipped false gods would also fall degradation perhaps become heterosexual however find argument somewhat forced fact homosexual readers seriously proposed paul meant however convinced rom sufficient create law homosexuality christians paul describing rom homosexuality among christians homosexuality appeared among idolaters one part whole package wickedness despite impression left impassioned rhetoric sure paul believe pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex given description situation rather assume heterosexual sex would also debased shameless yes believe passage indicates negative view homosexuality fairness shameless nature acts reflection general spiritual state people specific feature homosexuality overall view situation following think enough evidence confident paul disapproved homosexuality rom seems clear cor tim unambiguous general condemnations homosexuality seem like wording would come someone approved homosexuality even considered acceptable cases hand none passages contains explicit teachings subject rom really idolatry refers homosexuality passing result situation people interpret passages light general approach scripture look scripture laws issues surprising would consider passages endorsement prohibition whose approach bible liberal surprising regard paul negative view homosexuality something took jewish upbringing without serious reexamination light gospel readers group know assumptions behind approaches radically different people tend foam mouth see opposing view described lot moderator situation number discussions past centered around sort detailed exegesis texts described however fact convinced defenders homosexuality actually base beliefs analyses real issue seems rest question whether paul judgement apply modern homosexuality one commonly made claim paul simply never faced kinds questions trying deal encountered homosexuality contexts people would probably agree wrong never faced experience christians try act straight fail never faced christians trying define christian homosexuality fits general christian ideals fidelity seeing sexuality mirror relationship god man unfair take paul judgement homosexuality among idolaters use make judgements questions another following paul time homosexuality associated number things christians would find acceptable part temple prostitution among private citizens often occured adults children free people slaves position say always reasons think ancients distinguished active passive partner considered disgraceful free adult act passive partner reason active mode homosexual prostitute would considered disgraceful customers would people enjoyed passive role supports idea would tend engaged two free adult males least without degree scandal clearly christian homosexuals would condone sex children slaves others position fully responsible partners however fee commentary cor cites examples ancient literature homosexual relationships seem involve free adults reasonably symmetrical way thus considerations paragraph pushed far homosexuality may discredited jews associations surely must cases prostitutes involve slaves children people argued aids judgement homosexuality like point aids transmitted promiscuous sex homosexual heterosexual someone homosexual relationship meets christian criteria marriage risk aids note good reason paul general approach doubt would concede homosexuality fully equal alternative apart specific statements homosexuality believe use genesis story would lead regard heterosexual marriage god ordained however way paul deals pastoral questions provides

jehovah supreme deity god father christ came mortality begotten son mcconkie stated mormons believe today truth matter said elohim father jehovah son thus aware far astray religious intellectualists gone defining three one god comes surprise learn thrash around darkness trying identify elohim jehovah show relationship promised messiah sectarians even believe jehovah supreme deity whose son came mortality begotten concept god spirit misinformation gods heaven untrue fact attested holy writ elohim father jehovah son born mortality lord jesus christ promised messiah promised messiah notice mcconkie said christians wrong three one god belief god spirit understanding elohim jehovah examining mcconkie attack validity shall read statements mcconkie mormon sources concerning words elohim jehovah mcconkie stated chief designation christ preserved old testament ancient work published exalted name title jehovah promised messiah elohim plural word though also used exalted name title god eternal father usage connotes supremacy omnipotence god gods mormon doctrine agreeing mcconkie question elohim jehovah apostle james talmage stated elohim understood used restored church jesus christ name title god eternal father whose firstborn son spirit jehovah begotten flesh jesus christ jesus christ doctrinal exposition first presidency twelve apostles mormon church states god eternal father designate exalted name title elohim articles faith christ preexistent antemortal unembodied state known jehovah articles faith today mormon leaders teach elohim refers god father jehovah refers christ mcconkie attacked christians saying jehovah refer father stressed two name titles changed around christ called elohim father called jehovah father elohim jehovah jehovah christ christ jehovah one person promised messiah kjv bible hebrew word elohim used refer true god false gods goddesses judges israel referring true god elohim translated capital referring false gods goddesses judges israel translated small translated four times judges exod judge sam twice mighty gen exod angels godly mal great gen great sam word jehovah traditional pronunciation tetragrammation yhwh yhvh vowel points taken word adonai many people believe true pronunciation tetragrammation yahweh yahveh however since jehovah rather yahweh word used mormonism section also use jehovah instead yahweh examine validity claims mormon leaders regarding name jehovah unlike elohim never used false gods personal name triune god bible kjv jehovah rendered primarily lord sometimes god rarely lord understand something words elohim jehovah use mormon leaders shall consider apostle mcconkie attack christians believing father jehovah trying prove jehovah refers exclusively christ mcconkie cited several verses bible verses mcconkie interpretation examined see whether right remember mcconkie said father jehovah elohim first example shall consider involves mcconkie interpretation verse stated spake david tongue touched holy spirit testified lord said unto lord sit thou right hand make thine enemies thy footstool two lords involved one speaking one greater one making provision triumph glory message contained messianic prophecy think christ lord asked certain detractors toward end mortal ministry whose son christ son god someone else born divine parent men mortal son mortal father descendant david matter great pride jews answered son david david son truly much lord irrefutable logic complete discomfiture asked doth david spirit call lord saying lord said unto lord sit thou right hand till make thine enemies thy footstool david call lord son son david great king acting inspiration calls lord worships might add lord one spake unto david lord question jesus interpreting words psalm saying means father said unto son elohim said unto jehovah sit thou right hand mortal ministry raise eternal glory exaltation continue sit right hand forever promised messiah emphasis added agreeing statement mcconkie following remark mormon pamphlet mormons think christ reads lord elohim father said unto lord jehovah son brackets original mcconkie clearly stated elohim father speaking jehovah son psalm however one looks hebrew word translated lord becomes apparent either first lord father else father jehovah either way mcconkie wrong psalm reads lord jehovah said unto lord adon sit thou right hand make thine enemies thy footstool first lord verse jehovah mormonism says christ father second lord hebrew word adon singular adonai meaning master lord first lord father second lord son father jehovah son adon however father jehovah mcconkie claimed first lord jehovah son adon obviously father jehovah psalm son adon another example involves isa mcconkie stated following lord called thee righteousness isaiah quoted father saying christ hold thine hand keep thee give thee covenant people light gentiles isa promised messiah emphasis added mcconkie said father speaking christ passage reads lord jehovah called thee righteousness hold thine hand keep thee give thee covenant people light gentiles isa according mcconkie lord refers father thine thee refer christ however lord speaking jehovah means either mcconkie wrong speaking else father jehovah another example involves verses mcconkie stated shoot lip shake head saying trusted lord would deliver let deliver seeing delighted fulfillment jesus hung cross found words chief priests mocking scribes elders said saved others save king israel let come cross believe trusted god let deliver said son god thieves also crucified cast teeth matt promised messiah emphasis added reads follows see laugh scorn shoot lip shake head saying trusted lord jehovah would deliver let deliver seeing delighted mcconkie said verses fulfillment jesus hung cross means person scorned verses christ lord trusted jehovah father another example involves regarding mcconkie stated following reference conniving conspiring plots incident lord arrest judicial trials prophecy took counsel together devised take away life mine familiar friend trusted eat bread hath lifted heel promised messiah apostle mcconkie said psalms refer christ arrest judicial trials shall first consider mcconkie quoted verse verse also included give complete understanding matter heard slander many fear every side took counsel together devised take away life trusted thee lord jehovah said thou art god elohim mcconkie said verse referred jesus christ verse goes tell christ trusted lord called god elohim mormonism teaches god jesus elohim father verse however reveals elohim man jesus jehovah father mcconkie quoted one verse however two verses considered examination yea mine familiar friend trusted eat bread hath lifted heel thou lord jehovah merciful unto raise may requite mcconkie stated verse referred judas role christ death since judas familiar friend lifted heel pronouns mine verse must refer christ notice beginning verse change pronoun thou refers lord jehovah pronouns refer christ used means christ speaking jehovah father verses another example involves mcconkie following remark one great messianic prophecies spoken mouth david ever order melchizedek promised messiah mcconkie admitted messianic prophecy involving christ question verse refers christ lord jehovah hath sworn repent thou art priest ever order melchizedek lord jehovah refer christ mcconkie right jesus jehovah father lord would refer christ one addressed priest forever order melchizedek bible reveals one referred jesus christ heb therefore lord jehovah father another example involves isa verses mcconkie stated atoning sacrifice future messiah isaiah said lord laid iniquities pleased lord bruise promised messiah emphasis added mcconkie rightly said verses refer atoning sacrifice future messiah however failed mention also prove father jehovah verse reads like sheep gone astray turned every one way lord jehovah hath laid christ iniquity verse reads yet pleased lord jehovah bruise christ obviously lord laid christ iniquity bruised god father called jehovah verses remember mcconkie stated sectarians even believe jehovah supreme deity christ came mortality begotten son called concept misinformation untrue prove mcconkie misinformed believing untruth two scriptural references sam examined mcconkie stated following regarding scriptures midst passage clearly messianic lord says seed david father shall son sam second psalm whole also clearly messianic occurs statement thou art son day begotten thee paul quotes statements hebrews says prophecies christ would come son god promised messiah mcconkie cited heb show sam refer christ would come son god since mcconkie first referenced sam examination however along verse verses also included since time commanded judges people israel caused thee rest thine enemies also lord jehovah telleth thee make thee house thy days fulfilled thou shalt sleep thy fathers set thy seed thee shall proceed thy bowels establish kingdom shall build house name stablish throne kingdom ever father shall son sam verses teach lord jehovah would son messiah second example mcconkie cited examination include verse notice lord jehovah says thou art son day begotten thee declare decree lord jehovah hath said unto thou art son day begotten thee ask shall give thee heathen thine inheritance uttermost parts earth thy possession mcconkie said verses scripture clearly messianic acknowledged teach christ would come son god willing acknowledge however scriptures also teach father jehovah sectarians believe jehovah supreme deity whose son jesus christ begotten right belief another example involves mic verse mcconkie stated following truly lord act mortal ministry truly written shall stand feed strength lord majesty name lord god shall great unto ends earth mic promised messiah emphasis added according mcconkie pronoun beginning mic refers christ mortal ministry lord god mic reads christ shall stand feed strength lord jehovah majesty name lord jehovah god elohim shall great unto ends earth obviously lord jesus christ jehovah father referred jehovah elohim another example involves isa verses mcconkie stated following number messianic passages speak lord anointed signifying chosen one consecrated set apart ministry mission jesus applied passages quoting isaiah prophecy lord hath anointed preach good tidings unto meek isa saying day scripture fulfilled ears luke promised messiah emphasis added first source mcconkie quoted reads follows kings earth set rulers take counsel together lord jehovah anointed mcconkie said anointed one christ true jehovah jehovah always christ anointed one obviously jehovah referring god father anointed indeed referring christ second source mcconkie cited isa states spirit lord adonai god jehovah upon lord jehovah hath anointed preach good tidings unto meek hath sent bind brokenhearted proclaim liberty captives opening prison bound one anointed preach bind proclaim open jesus christ one anointed verse says lord jehovah anointing face problem jehovah refer father christ jesus anointed someone mcconkie pointed jesus applied passages therefore jehovah anointed christ god father examples could cited show mcconkie mormon leaders wrong say god father jehovah however enough expose error mormonism claim jesus jehovah elohim true jesus jehovah following

anyone check let restrict christians want find commandments books regarded scripture going pass psychologizing answers whether dismissive open kind issue deal question theological point involved quoted often enough believe take seriously jesus said said love obey commands john like christian slave christ wills also instead younger brother still direction though call god abba christians therefore try find lord commands discovering feel obligated confess failure readers may set aside theologizing jargon slaves christ point adherents religion read texts whether classified inspired held models effort find application situations practice ranges devotional reading sermons like exegesis canon ical scripture word god highest pitch leads question whether find inspired scripture something act absolute guidance actions problem finding lord commands going set aside essay one major direction christians looked commands namely christian tradition reject tradition primary audience essay protestants deny tradition determinative value favor witness scripture question want deal commandments find lord scripture turns hard question protestant inquisitors would like turn discussion authority tradition accomodate unlike protestants episcopalians admit claims scripture reason tradition roughly equal standing earlier john quote read john give new commandment love one another place christians given explicit commandment context commenting imperative mode pronouncement jesus meal readers infer since john synoptics jesus says take bread body mark matthew luke corinthians mode imperative greek labete hence commandment cases infer command directed wider circle immediate collocation disciples judge evangelist point mentioning disciples mostly entirely dead expected follow commandment lord case communion paul mention least probably true evangelists also implies ongoing ritual liturgy words operate bind christians original command disciples continuing commandment christian community entirely comfortable inference must point occasion jesus spoke command take clear inference least evangelist notion christians called love one another jesus command directed disciples call attention inference command apply without generalization specific context statement context disciple christ reading scripture make inferences get sense text whatsoever general problem reading texts read without understanding native languages normally read translated texts without appreciation original context points original languages english misleads going presume follows general problem read scripture control really think true suffice current purposes address issues arise already coped understanding year old text another world one live questions level introduce reser vations commandments issue found stipulating read texts original audience might done among reasons seeing john agapate allelou general commandment merely instruction jesus disciples one occasion one linking synoptic great commandment criticism jesus limiting love congenially associate matthew read learnt say love enemies fact leviticus context quoted say hate enemy merely common human presumption leviticus pains say love extend strangers amongst people israel luke expanding context goes jesus say even sinners love love suggests quite strongly say limiting scope new commandment quite jesus mind short inference leads generalizing actual text command force christians objects limited christians trickier agapate allelou institution communion case great commission matthew mark twelve sent evangelize proclaim kingdom heaven close hand verb imperative russete context rather specific twelve specifiers turn steps pagan territory enter samaritan town lukan parallels even specific jesus final journey jerusalem make harder see generalizing christians previous examples prevented christians making inference call attention inference justified text unlike first two cases cite rhetoric evangelist urged reader still paul seems felt obliged proclaim kingdom heaven close hand even contrary jesus instructions gentiles ends earth christians also taken commandment sense john accept know surely rather speculative see ripples inference spread text pretext christians may infer general commandment applicable presented gospels specific occasion necessarily object kind generalization insist people make must understanding reasoning considerable length actually scripture assumptions involved reasoning scriptural though people best justify assumptions references scripture simply adds inference mix let move great commandment love god whole hearts minds souls perhaps synoptic equivalent john agapate allelou yet presented commandment texts rather context controversy pharisees cite matthew pharisees heard silenced sadducees got together disconcert one put question master greatest commandment law means obvious though accept jesus answer meant commandment christians answering polemic enemies mark account casts answer far positive light scribe version says far important holocaust need point word originates context animal sacrifice forget nazis sacrifice luke intermediate lawyer posing question disconcert jesus gets good samarian parable pains luke contexts confusingly various one could forgiven drawing inferences account said obviously taken commandment binding christians though think entirely reasonable conclusion case jesus thinks point mental gears grind cycle get conclusion commanded jesus contingent understanding point jesus use torah quite different gospel accounts application context different contexts among synoptics curious noted luke get fixing command parable good samaritan may look analogous intent matthew gives golden rule meaning law prophets may also hear echo hillel saying generation jesus make associations think entirely reasonable indulging inference texts explicitly support rather read texts kind inter relationship current literary theory calls intertextuality discussion agapate allelou apply beyond community disciples beyound circle christian believers applies buttress conclusion despite presentation saying explicitly commandment christians christians would disagree conclusions must point conclusions depend rather elaborate chains reasoning simply present texts contextual problem keeps coming severely look sayings jesus universally taken christians commandments get really hard cases take divorce mark pretty clear man divorces wife marries another guilty adultery luke except matthew escape clause except case fornication seems rather clear commandment whether take matthew reservation christians day take least practice rather peculiar jesus explicit whereas says nothing things people gnash teeth possible commands christ clear matthew disagree evangelists synoptic tradition going continue examination ever murkier waters enough start theme finding commandments scripture exercise inference inferences informed assumptions cultural biases far identified commandments generally accepted christians yet already difficulties start surface difficulties want discuss next essay topic divorce commandment already strikes difficulties see almost evidence people eager find commandments condemn spend time writing nasty screeds soc couples misc legal horrors viciousness divorce demanding law refuse allow refuse unrepentant divorcees places churches say divorce enter consideration general definitely matter concern even liberal church circles example wildly liberal episcopalian priest aqauintence wildly

distributing keys special agencies must funded monitored chips designed military contractor whose design remain secret manufactured special process chip becomes nearly impossible take apart chips offered relatively high price peice lots private encryption systems supporting wiretaps would require none extra costs perhaps important government degree would least partially replace private marketplace evolution standards voice represented encrypted exchanged future phones widely believed governments less efficient private enterprise procuring products standards though may perhaps perform useful brokering role choose competing private standards much less efficient matter debate say pay twice much others might say currently total billion spent operating expenses phone companies
