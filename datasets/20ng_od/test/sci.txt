special trust agencies could thereby listen future previously recorded conversations phone date concerns voiced plan security government disclose encryption algorithm many suspect government limit

society investigate crime force phone communications support wiretaps give police agencies money investigate crimes ways put another way would police agencies willing pay wiretap pay share full social

conversation arrests resulted wiretaps started year arrests came wiretaps previous years arrests led convictions wiretaps phones pagers email etc regarding drug offenses requested federal authorities wiretap installation heard average calls incriminating among people cost average extrapolating installations reporting costs mostly labor thus total million spent wiretaps obtain arrests per arrest

expensive wiretaps annual social benefit phone wiretaps equal current spending level two cents month per phone line wiretap costs let moment optimistically assume government encryption scheme secure whatever private enterprise would offered instead protecting conversations spying ears neighbors corporations governments foreign domestic even need support wiretaps would add many additional costs

distributing keys special agencies must funded monitored chips designed military contractor whose design remain secret manufactured special process chip becomes nearly impossible take apart chips offered relatively high price peice lots private encryption systems supporting wiretaps would require none extra costs perhaps important government degree would least partially replace private marketplace evolution standards voice represented encrypted exchanged future phones widely believed governments less efficient private enterprise procuring products standards though may perhaps perform useful brokering role choose competing private standards much less efficient matter debate say pay twice much others might say currently total billion spent operating expenses phone companies comes per month per access line compare wiretap value two cents per month see wiretaps raise average operating costs even much one part wiretaps cost effective even include extra costs phone owners
